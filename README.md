# ASSIGNMENT 2
Made 3D by Nima Elien (nimae@sfu.ca) using starting 2D template from Chong Guo (armourg@sfu.ca)

All required features implemented. You're given a 5 second timer to drop the tile. Timer at top of window, when the game is over, the timer informs the user the game is over. 

No bonus features implemented. 

http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-3-matrices/ Was used to setup the 3d view. And code from https://www.cs.unm.edu/~angel/BOOK/INTERACTIVE_COMPUTER_GRAPHICS/SIXTH_EDITION/CODE/CHAPTER08/WINDOWS_VERSIONS/ was used for the building of the robot. 

Minor issue, timer starts on a slight delay when you first start the game up. It will pause for a little bit then start timer. Not an issue when you restart it (by pressing 'r'), timer will start right away. 

Type 'make' to make.
